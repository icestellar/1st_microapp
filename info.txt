ESP32 integrates Bluetooth link controller and Bluetooth baseband, which carry out the baseband protocols and other low-level link routines, such as modulation/demodulation, packets processing, bit stream processing, frequency hopping, etc.
*Provides UART HCI interface, up to 4 Mbps
*Provides SDIO / SPI HCI interface
*Provides I2C interface for the host to do configuration
*Provides PCM / I2S audio interface

*Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)*
ESP32 has three UART interfaces, i.e. UART0, UART1 and UART2, which provide asynchronous communication
(RS232 and RS485) and IrDA support, and communicate at up to 5 Mbps. UART provides hardware management
of the CTS and RTS signals and software flow control (XON and XOFF). All of the interfaces can be accessed by
the DMA controller or directly by CPU.

(UART)
A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART /ˈjuːɑːrt/) is a computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. The electric signaling levels and methods are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART. A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit (IC) used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. One or more UART peripherals are commonly integrated in microcontroller chips. A related device, the universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter (USART) also supports synchronous operation.
The universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) takes bytes of data and transmits the individual bits in a sequential fashion.[1] At the destination, a second UART re-assembles the bits into complete bytes. Each UART contains a shift register, which is the fundamental method of conversion between serial and parallel forms. Serial transmission of digital information (bits) through a single wire or other medium is less costly than parallel transmission through multiple wires.
